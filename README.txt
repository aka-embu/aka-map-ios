RELEASE NOTES
--------------------

21.60 - 2020-09-24

- Fixes issue with sending wrong SDK version in analytics.



21.40 - 2020-07-02

- Fix for problem with processing some request errors



21.30 - 2020-06-04

- Fix for memory leak in URL request interception mechanism.
- Support for configure with an SDK specific plist file (instead of Application’s Info.plist)



21.21 - 2020-05-07

- Version parity with mPulse SDK.



21.13 - 2020-04-06

- Internal code size reduction.
- Added Swift samples in Integration Guide document



21.12 - 2020-02-27

- Support segment-level controls for network type (e.g., download this manifest's
  contents over wifi only).
- Support segment-level controls for alternate download sources.



21.11 - 2020-01-16

- Support downloading segments in priority order. 
  Priorities can be set at the MAP portal ingestion page.

- Open a fallback connection when SR4C can't connect to a hostname.
  Prevent SR4C on that hostname until the server configuration changes.

- API key and segment names from Info.plist have their start and end whitespace trimmed.



20.41 - 2019-12-19

- Provide direct cache access via API, with optional callbacks for cache changes.
- Prevent If-Modified-Since checks on cached files from being cached by the OS, 
  ensuring requests for updated content are fulfilled.



20.33 - 2019-11-06

- Replace internal use of UIWebView with WKWebView for getting default User-Agent.



20.32 - 2019-09-26

- Split framework into AkaCommon and AkaMap to combine
  support for MAP and mPulse SDKs.
- Reduce overall SDK size.



20.13 - 2019-04-18

- Internal optimizations.

KNOWN ISSUES
    No known issues.



20.12 - 2019-02-21

- Changing user segments causes an immediate sync with the server to get the 
  latest contents.  Previous behavior was to wait until next sync (e.g., app 
  coming to foreground if several minutes had passed since last sync).

- Ignore OPTIONS requests by default.  Ignore other HTTP/S request methods
  as follows, or set to nil to have MAP SDK intercept all requests:

  akaService.config.ignoredHTTPMethods = @[@"post",@"options"];

- Allow re-registration in case app is registered to the wrong license.
  If the app launches with a new license in the plist, the old one will 
  unregister followed by registering the new license.

  Similarly, if the (deprecated) register API is used, the previous license
  will deregister followed by registering the new license.  Plist is the
  preferred method.

  Note: This is intended to correct license errors, not to switch features
  at runtime. Features should be changed via the Web portal.
